          <p class="info">
            Death's Head Hawkmoths are among my favorite types of moth. There are three species of death's head moths, the most commonly known being <span id="bold">African Death's Head Hawkmoths</span>. Death's head hawkmoths are one of the few species of moth that have a functioning digestive system, and they typically feed on honey from beehives. They can mimic the pheromones of bees, which allows them to infiltrate their hives undisturbed, and even if they are deemed a threat by said bees, these kinds of moths have a special waxy coating on their bodies that helps prevent them from being stung. Another cool fact about these moths is that they have what is called a "tymbal organ" located in their abdomen, which essentially means they have a body part that vibrates to make noise. This noise, which resembles a high-pitched squeak, is used to ward off predators, though I think they're absolutely adorable.

          <h3 class="titleCard">Cinnabar Moth</h3>
  
          <p class="info">
            Cinnabar Moths have a distinct bright red and black coloration on their wings, with very little variation in said pattern between members of this species. This red/black coloration is the reason behind the name 'cinnabar moth', and for a good reason, since cinnabar moths are quite poisonous when ingested. Here's some extra information about their typical habitats and ranges across countries:
            
            <blockquote class="info" cite="https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/cinnabar">
              <q>
                Frequent in open grassy habitats including waste ground, railway banks, gardens and woodland rides but perhaps most frequent on well drained rabbit-grazed grassland, mature sand-dunes and heathland
              </q>
